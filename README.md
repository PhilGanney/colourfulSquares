# colourfulSquares
 For noodling on colour themes.

# Dev plans and intentions
## overview
This is something I'm building for myself, and because I wanted to do some HTML, CSS and JS coding this weekend. 
I also see some potential for it:
	as a dev tool or dev aide
	or as a way to help people think about colours and themes in a relaxed and easy manner.



## For web devs, who are used to working with HTML and CSS
Web devs who are used to HTML and CSS might find this useful for "noodling on colour themes" on their regular dev devices, even when there's no controls on the page to change the styling.
I find that this works well the dev tools built within Google Chrome on PC. Those tools let me use a colour picker, and even let me add in other styles really easily, while colourfulSquares gives a good choice of content to style with sensible yet easily overridden defaults.

## Maybe at some point
I might make this into a little web-app with controls to let people change the styles. It's a possibility that I'm open to doing at some point if it seems like a good use of my time.

## What does "noodling" mean in this context?
Noodling is the process of exploring and thinking about colours - perhaps for a project that is coming up, or to improve a design that doesn't quite look right, or to help figure out new branding.

## Uniqueness - or the lack of
I don't care if other people have built similar things. This will have some uniqueness, simply by it being built in my style, and the content I put in.
I can customize it how I want. Anyone forking this project can customize it as they want.

## Why HTML, CSS and JS?
I find this combination of languages have some advantages for this kind of project. I find them simple enough that I only need to give a tiny percentage of my thinking power to those techs. That leaves me with lots of space to think about design and the colours and the styles. Another huge advantage, is that I get precise colour values in a text file that I can easily copy from to paste wherever the colours are needed. I also have a huge amount of control over how it looks and the entire code base.
